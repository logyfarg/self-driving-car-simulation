# Self-Driving Car Simulation 🚗🧠

A Python-based simulation of a self-driving car using ray sensors, a simple neural network, and genetic algorithms. Built using `pygame`, this project visualizes how AI can learn to navigate through a 2D environment.

### 🔍 Features
- Ray-based sensor system
- Neural Network-based decision making
- Genetic algorithm for training
- Real-time 2D simulation using Pygame
- Manual control mode to collect training data (coming soon!)

### 🧠 Tech Stack
- Python
- Pygame
- NumPy
- Custom-built neural network and genetic algorithm

### 📁 File Structure
- `simulation.py` - Main runner
- `car.py` - Car logic (movement, drawing, fitness)
- `brain.py` - Neural Network and evolution logic
- `utils.py` - Sensor ray logic and helpers
